<h3>Prerequisites </h3> <br>
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

You should also be familiar with basic JavaScript concepts. <br>


<h3> Setting Up Your Environment in Visual Studio Code </h3> 
- Download the project files or clone the repository <br>
- Open project in VSCode <br>

<h4> Install Project Dependencies </h4>
In the VSCode terminal: <br>
- Navigate to project directory (if not already there) <br>

Confirm installation with: <br>
- node -v <br>
- npm -v <br>

Then: <br>

<h3>To Do's & Reminders</h3>
At first compilation, there will be errors (huge surprise there). <br>
Use the tools & techniques on the provided strategy guide, think logically, try to adapt a "debugging mindset", and ask questions! <br> 
Running into problems is the whole point of this exercise and having a good mental model of the language is key to debugging in general. If you encounter issues relating to syntax you are not familiar with, feel free to ask about it or utilize online resources like: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3Schools</a> <br>
